# 1.rule_based_chatbot


Welcome to the Restaurant Recommendation Chatbot repository! This project showcases a simple rule-based chatbot that provides restaurant recommendations based on user input. It demonstrates the use of natural language processing (NLP) to understand user intent and engage in basic conversations.



# 2.tictactoe-game- 


I led a project crafting an unbeatable AI for Tic-Tac-Toe against human players. Implementing Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning, the AI predicted game outcomes by simulating moves and countermoves.

# 3.RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM

simple recommendation system designed to provide personalized movie recommendations to users based on their preferences. The system employs two main techniques: collaborative filtering and content-based filtering.

# Collaborative Filtering: 
This method analyzes user interactions and behaviors to find similarities between users. It then recommends movies that similar users have enjoyed. In other words, it harnesses the collective wisdom of users to make suggestions.

# Content-Based Filtering:
In addition to collaborative filtering, the system also uses content-based filtering. This approach takes into account specific attributes of movies, such as genres, directors, or actors, and matches them with a user's preferences. This way, it tailors recommendations based on the intrinsic characteristics of the movies and the user's stated preferences.
